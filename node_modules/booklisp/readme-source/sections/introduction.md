#### What Booklisp Is ####

Booklisp is a language for people who want the compositional support LaTeX provides, but with the ease of Markdown authoring. Although Booklisp is still in the developmental stages, it is still possible to build large, complex documents without setting your hair on fire.

Booklisp content is just Markdown.  Any Booklisp Markdown is valid Github Flavored Markdown (GFM) with embedded HTML comments.

Booklisp executable blocks are a simple DSL utilizing Lisp-style syntax, making the work of composing complex documents little more than declaring what you want... and a few parens.

This readme was even created with Booklisp!

#### What Booklisp Is Not ####

Booklisp is NOT a complete, standalone language.  It is simply designed to make the process of compiling documents simpler for authors.

Booklisp is NOT a replacement for LaTeX.  If you need the power, the language exists for a reason.

Booklisp is NOT finished.  It is likely the project will continue to grow over time.  To see the current state of the project it is worth having a look at the todo list.
