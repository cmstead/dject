Working with require statements violates one of the core tenants of Martin Fowler's rule for depending on abstractions over concretions. This is because every time you require a module, you are telling Node you want precisely one file which provides precisely one API.  To break these dependencies, you have to build factories... lots of them.

DJect is built to simplify workflow to declaring where your node modules live in your project and then simply requesting them as needed. Any modules not loaded directly through the container.register() endpoint are lazily loaded from the filesystem just in time to fulfill the dependency need. This means your application only loads the dependencies it needs and you don't have to spend your time worrying about managing your dependency chain by hand with massive factory trees.
